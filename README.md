# Digit-Recognizing
This project is a digit recognizer based on the famous MNIST dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Overview

This project uses a dataset of grayscale images containing handwritten digits, with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. The model is trained to predict the correct digit for each image, making it useful for applications in digit classification, such as postal code recognition or form processing.

### Main Features:
- Data preprocessing, including normalization and reshaping.
- Implementation of a deep learning model using a neural network to classify digits.
- Model evaluation, including accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualization.

## Installation

To run this notebook locally, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the library used in the notebook)
- Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization

You can install the required packages via pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd digit-recognizer
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook digit_recognizer.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to load the data, train the model, and test its accuracy.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used in this project. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The dataset is publicly available and can be loaded directly using TensorFlow or other libraries.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a simple feedforward neural network with the following layers:
- Input layer: Takes in 28x28 pixel values, flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
- Hidden layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
- Output layer: A softmax layer with 10 neurons, each representing a digit from 0 to 9.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset, demonstrating strong performance on handwritten digit classification.
